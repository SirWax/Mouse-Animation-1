## Simple dynamic mouse animation wallpaper/background  made in JavaScript.
- Shoots random color blobs around the mouse when the mouse moves. Does nothing otherwise. *Very Satisfying* :relieved::pinched_fingers:.
- Shows a trail whose width changes dynamically with the speed of the mouse. (Slow mouse has a thinner trail).
- Can be easily used as a wallpaper. Try [Lively](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively/)

## Setup and run
- Download all the files
- Run index.html on your localhost.

## Future plans
- Add suptle lighting behind the mouse as it moves.
- Make background dynamic (Maybe like a space time mesh).
